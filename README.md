# IntU

## Description

*IntU* is a package for Mathematica computer algebra system, which allows to
calculate polynomial integrals over the unitary group with respect to the Haar
measure.

## Installation

The package can be installed by placing `IntU.m` file in `Applications`
subdirectory of `.Mathematica` directory.

## Documentation

Help messages for the implemented functions are document in `IntU_functions.nb`
notebook. The are also available in the PDF format in `IntU_functions.pdf`.


## Usage and citing

Usage examples are provided in `IntU_examples.nb` notebook.
